\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:backml:intro}

 Therefore this chapter aims at giving to a reader with basic knowledge of \acrshort{ml} the keys to understand our contributions. It is not aimed at being a thorough presentation of the different methods but rather an overview. For the readers who would still like to deepen their knowledge about these methods, we will provide pointers to relevant litterature.  

\section{What is machine learning ?} 
\label{sec:backml:whatisml}

\acrlong{ml} is a subfield of artificial intelligence which focuses on methods enabling computers to learn from experience, in the form of data. More formally, a machine learning algorithm is defined by a set of candidate models (\ie an hypothesis space $\mathfrak{H}$)
